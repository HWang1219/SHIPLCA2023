  SHIPLYS:
SHIPLYS (Ship life cycle software solutions) is a three-year project starting in September 2016 and has a budget of about 6.2 million Euros.

The project is in response to needs of SME naval architects, shipbuilders and ship-owners, who in order to survive in the world market require to:

-improve their capability to reduce the time and costs of design and production
-develop the ability to reliably produce better ship concepts through virtual prototyping
-meet the increasing requirements for LCCA (Life Cycle Cost Analysis), environmental assessments, risk assessments and end-of-life considerations as differentiators.

The calculation and modelling to achieve the functionalities required are difficult and time consuming, especially for SMEs without a large overhead of trained staff and tools. This is due to challenges in integrating data between incompatible tools and formats for different design stages: conceptual hull design; the finite element calculations feeding preliminary and detailed designs; and virtual prototyping simulation models. This is coupled with the lack of an industry specific lifecycle modelling technique, hindered by the lack of information to support reliable decision-making. SHIPLYS aims to address these challenges for the benefit of various stakeholders involved.# 17042019

  SHIPLYS LCT：
The SHIPLYS Life Cycle Tool (LCT) has been developed to help designers during the early stages of the design process.
The LCT software can be used by shipyards and design offices for the evaluation of their early designs with respect to cost, environmental assessment, risk assessment and end-of-life considerations. The LCT software can also be used for the evaluation of retrofitting projects. 

  Objectives：
The direct economic costs of production (CAPEX), operation and maintenance costs (OPEX) and repair and end-of-life costs can be used in combination with environmental impact and risk assessment to evaluate and compare different designs, maintenance and replacement strategies for ships based on a through life perspective by quantifying:
-	Life Cycle Cost Assessment – LCCA
-	Life Cycle Assessment – LCA 
-	Risk Assessment – RA
